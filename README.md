Just for the sake of documentation: the general idea here is to combine a bit of CS and a bit of Economics to 
test our ability to model a market. in this case we're going to use cryptocurrency markets under the assumption
that their drivers are almost entirely limited to simple speculation. We need a way to gather data on "speculaton" for
a time period, and then work out how we can best match speculation to actual price fluctuations.


The big questions:(feel free to edit this)
1. What will our speculation data be? (first suggestion is mentionings of currency by name on social media)
2. How can we gather enough unbiased data to be confident it represents a true sample of speculation?
3. How can we best model it? (first suggestion is to throw shit at the wall until something sticks)
4. Can our process be made fast enough for real-time predictions?
5. Will our results, or our process, be useful for anything other than real-time predictions?
